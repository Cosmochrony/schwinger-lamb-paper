Section 1 — Motivation and Scope
Pourquoi Lamb + Schwinger sont les tests ultimes d’un cadre pré-géométrique
Limites ontologiques de la QED standard (sans polémique)

Section 2 — Projective Origin of Vacuum Effects
Non-injectivity of $\Pi$ in high-resolution regimes
Definition of projective resolution limit $h$
Distinction between dynamical vacuum and projective noise

Section 3 — Lamb Shift as Projective Spectral Noise
Review of the Lamb shift phenomenology
Failure of perfect localization in $s$-states
Relation to the local relational Laplacian spectrum
Why QED gets the value right for the wrong reason

Section 4 — Schwinger Effect as Flux Saturation
Critical field as projective flux bound
Breakdown of injectivity and pair production
Born–Infeld-like saturation and non-perturbativity
Structural origin of the exponential rate

Section 5 — Unified Interpretation via $\alpha$
$\alpha$ as a ratio of projective capacity to resolution
Same invariant controlling Lamb and Schwinger regimes
Why this unification is invisible in standard QED

Section 6 — Experimental Constraints and Outlook
What current Lamb measurements already constrain
Where deviations could appear (strong fields, precision spectroscopy)
Why this regime is falsifiable

Section 7 — Discussion and Conceptual Implications
Status of the quantum vacuum
Renormalization as an effective encoding
Position of Cosmochrony relative to QED
